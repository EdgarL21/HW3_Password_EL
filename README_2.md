For this project, we were tasked to make a Random Password Generator. The HTML and CSS was already done for us. I did add a couple of tags a <div> and an <input> to the HTML. And a hover background color change to the CSS. 

For the Javascript, the code will ask you how many characters you want in your password. Then press the generate button to get the password.
